Hrishi Singh
I'm interested in data analysis, where I leverage data to extract insights and make data-driven decisions.
I'm currently learning advanced SQL Server techniques to master data querying and manipulation. I'm also diving deeper into Python for data analysis, exploring libraries like pandas and NumPy to enhance my analytical skills. Additionally, I'm honing my data visualization expertise using Power BI and refining my data modeling abilities in Excel. I'm excited to keep expanding my knowledge and staying updated with the latest data analysis techniques
I'm looking to collaborate on data analysis projects that involve extracting actionable insights from complex datasets. I'm open to collaborating on open-source data analysis libraries, data visualization projects, or any initiatives that leverage data to solve real-world problems.
